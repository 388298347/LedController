LedControl is an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) library for MAX7219 and MAX7221 Led display drivers.
The code should work with most boards and architectures but I only test it for the ESP32 Dev Module.
Feel free to create an issue if something is missing or not working correctly.

## Documentation

Documentation for the library is on the [Github Project Pages](http://noah1510.github.io/LedController/)

## Download

The lastest binary version of the Library is always available from the [LedController Release Page](https://github.com/noah1510/LedController/releases)

## Install

The library can be installed using the [standard Arduino library install procedure](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

## Supported Editors

The library includes a keywords.txt for the [Arduino ide](https://www.arduino.cc/) and a configuration for visual studio code (with the [platform.io extention](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide)).
